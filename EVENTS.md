# ðŸš€ Events
All events will be time stamped and named.
These properties can be accessed through the `event.Time()` and `event.Name()` functions.

Events are streamed over a buffered channel which is accessible through 
```go
st := space_traders.New("TOKEN", "USERNAME").EventsChannel()
``` 
function.

## ðŸ”§ Event Reference
The event reference is structured as follows:
```
[Event] Name of the event (event.Name())
  - Model, a link to the source for the event struct.
  - [Type] Name of type (event.Type)
    - Some events may have this field.
    - Sub type, e.g.: a ship order is either BUY or SELL
  - [Field] Name of public fields contained in this event.
    - e.g: For a flight plan event: 
           Plan is accessible through event.Plan
```
Events will often have fields containing a model with the relevant data.
E.g.: A FLIGHT_PLAN event will contain the `models.FlightPlan` structure under the `event.Plan` field.
